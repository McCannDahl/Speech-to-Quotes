 A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid(3 Nephi 12:14).
And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning(3 Nephi 11:11).
